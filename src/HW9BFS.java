     * 15 points: In main, test your Graph class and perform breadth-first search.
     Manually initialize at least three boolean 2D arrays of the adjacency matrices of a few different graphs,
     each fully connected with at least 5 vertices. You may want to draw them on paper first, then write down
     the adjacency matrices.
     With each matrix, construct a Graph object, and perform a breadth-first search. Afterward, you'll want to
     printGraph and also print out all the vertices.  (By reading all the parent labels in the Vertex print
     statements, you could draw the breadth-first tree on paper to make sure it's working correctly.)
     You must implement your methods and classes described above from scratch, using your own code from the
     previous homework as a starting point. You may use the following parts of the Java Standard Library:

     console I/O and its associated classes
     Exception handling code
     java.util.LinkedList<E>, but only to construct one, and invoke the Queue interface methods offer
     (that's your ENQUEUE), poll (that's your DEQUEUE), and peek. Documentation about this Java interface is here.
