/**
 * 45 points: Define a class named Graph to represent a graph, in a fashion
 * conducive to breadth-first searching. Private Data fields will be: "n", an
 * int for the number of vertices in the graph. "edges", a 2D boolean array of
 * size n-by-n, to store an adjacency matrix. "vertices", a length-n array of
 * Vertex, to store information about each vertex. "queue", a LinkedList<Vertex>
 * to be used only for queue operations. (The LinkedList class conveniently
 * implements the Queue Java Interface.) You'll want to make a public getter
 * method for n. You'll also want a public getter method for a Vertex, with a
 * parameter index i indicating the Vertex label to return. e.g. getVertex(3)
 * would return the Vertex handle whose label is 3. The constructor will take a
 * 2D boolean square array (that means the same length in both dimensions), as a
 * parameter. You may assume the matrix is square. The constructor should
 * construct an empty LinkedList for your queue, initialize the n data field,
 * copy the entire parameter 2D array into a brand new copy for your edges data
 * field, and init and construct your array of vertices with labels 0 through
 * n-1. Define a printGraph class method to print n, and then a nicely formatted
 * table of the adjacency matrix. Define a breadthFirstSearch class method, to
 * perform a breadth-first search. The only parameter sourceLabel is a number
 * between 0 and n-1, the label of the source vertex. You will want to create a
 * local Vertex handle s, set to element sourceLabel of your Vertex array, right
 * away. You will also want to use the Queue Java interface methods offer
 * (that's your ENQUEUE), poll (that's your DEQUEUE), and peek, on your queue.
